He was a powerfully built man with a shaved head. He
was listening to the football game on his radio. “I have
Dr. Christopher Abaddon for Ms. Katherine Solomon?”

The guard nodded. “Identification, please.” :

The chauffeur looked surprised. “I’m sorry, didn’t

The guard nodded, stealing a glance at the television.
‘I'm still required to scan and log visitor idéntification.
Sorry, regulations. I’ll need to see the doctor’s ID.”

“Not a problem.” The chauffeur turned backward in
his seat and spoke in hushed tones through the privacy
screen. As he did, the guard stole another peek at the

game. The Redskins were breaking from the huddle
now, and he hoped to get this limo through before the

next play.
